# GAN

This repository contains code and data for semi-supervised learning to train a model to automatically grade raw coffee beans. To generate images it uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and feeds both the real images and the generated images to the classifier model.

### Result
 The image below shows some of the generated images of beans as the training progresses.
